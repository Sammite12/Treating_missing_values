# Treating_missing_values
This project treats missing values  using different techniques and checking their accuracy
Techniques like dropping missing values, filling missing values with median, imputing missing values with predicted values, clustering, and multiple imputation
by chain equation were used to treat missing values. I used logistic regression to train the model for each technique. while they may have closely the same accuracies,
it must be noted that each method uniquely depends on the different datasets. Therefore, it is important to know why the values were missing originally before treating missing values
